The initial README for group 14's COMP30022 project, Fleet Commander. 


### How do I get set up? ###

The project has been set-up using Android studio, and thus the steps to get set up are as follows:

Via CLI:
-Navigate to the directory in which you want to store the project

-"git init"

-"git remote add origin https://jmclaren_unimelb@bitbucket.org/14comp30022/fleet-commander.git"

-"git pull -u origin development"

Via Android Studio:

-Via the menu: File->Import Project

-Through the file browser navigate to the directory in which the project is stored (the one mentioned above) and click ok

-This will open up the project in your Android studio workspace

To then build the project you can click the green play button in the top menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut shift + f10. (If you want to run the device on a physical device ensure that you have the appropriate drivers installed and have USB debugging enabled on the target device)

[Note that master branch shall be maintained as the most recent working version of the project (initial build at the moment) with merges only being made from development once significant milestones have been reached.]
